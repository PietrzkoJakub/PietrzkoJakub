About Me:

As a child, solving problems related to computer, both hardware andsoftware, gave me great satisfaction. From that moment on, I knew that
I wanted to tie my future with IT. When I started learning coding in college,solving a given problem gave me a lot of satisfaction. At this moment,
I found that I wanted to further develop my skills and learn about newtechnologies in the field of software development.
